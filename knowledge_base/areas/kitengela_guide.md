## Investment Potential

### Why Kitengela is Hot in 2025-2026

2. **Infrastructure Boost**: Expressway + bypass = accessibility
3. **Affordability Gap**: 60-70% cheaper than equivalent property in Nairobi

5. **Diaspora Preference**: Top 3 choice for returning Kenyans

### ROI Projections (Conservative)
