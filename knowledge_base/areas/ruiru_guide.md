- **Prefer quiet/rural**: Ruiru is busy, urban feel
- **Need luxury amenities**: Limited high-end options

## Unique Selling Propositions

### Student Housing Angle
"JKUAT has 40,000 students and not enough hostels. Buy a 2-bedroom at KES 3.5M, rent to 4 students at KES 8K each. That's KES 32K monthly - your mortgage pays itself, and you build equity."

### Infrastructure Confidence
"Unlike emerging areas where you're betting on future roads, Thika Highway is done, TRM is open, JKUAT has been there 40 years. This is proven ground, not speculation."

### Commuter-Friendly
"Most Ruiru residents leave by 6:30am, beat traffic, reach CBD by 7am. Try doing that from Karen or Kilimani. Plus, if you work in Thika or Ruaraka, you're counter-traffic - 20 minutes max."

## Call-to-Action Suggestions

**For Student Housing Investors**:
"Let me show you the math: KES 3.5M apartment, 4 students, KES 32K monthly. In 5 years, you've earned KES 1.9M in rent PLUS the property is worth KES 5.2M. That's doubling your money. Want to see the units available?"

**For Families**:
"I have 3 excellent 3-bedroom options in Ruiru between KES 4.5M-6M. All in gated estates with playgrounds, near good schools. Can I send you the details so you can discuss with your family?"

**For Traffic-Concerned Buyers**:
"I understand the traffic worry. How about this: let's schedule a site visit at 7am so you can drive the route yourself during rush hour. You'll see it's manageable, and the savings vs. Nairobi make it worth it."

## Property Matching Tips

**Student Investor**: → 2-bedroom apartments near JKUAT, KES 3M-4M, focus on yield

**Diaspora Buyer**: → Off-plan apartments, managed estates, KES 3M-5M, rental-ready
