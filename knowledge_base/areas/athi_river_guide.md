Rent is KES 20K-25K for a 2-bedroom - affordable on factory salaries (KES 30K-60K). Our investors report 95%+ occupancy. Workers need to live near their jobs - that's you."

## Investment Potential

### Why Athi River Works for Investors

1. **Guaranteed Tenant Base**: 30,000+ industrial workers need housing
2. **Steady Demand**: Factories operate year-round (no seasonal vacancy)
3. **Affordable Entry**: KES 2M - KES 4M gets solid 2-bedroom
4. **High Occupancy**: Workers live close to avoid long commutes
5. **Rental Growth**: As more factories open, demand increases

### ROI Projections

**Worker Housing Model**:
- 2-bedroom apartment: KES 3M purchase
- Rent to factory supervisor: KES 22,000/month
- Annual income: KES 264,000 = 8.8% yield
- Plus 7-8% appreciation = 15-16% total return
- **Low Maintenance**: Workers maintain property well (fear losing job housing)

**Multiple Units Strategy**:
- Buy 3 units at KES 2.5M each = KES 7.5M total
- Rent each at KES 20K/month = KES 60K combined
- Annual: KES 720,000 = 9.6% yield
- Spread risk across multiple tenants

**Land for Warehouse + Residence**:
- ¼ acre plot: KES 2M
- Build warehouse ground floor (rent KES 50K-80K/month)
- Residential units on upper floor (KES 20K × 4 units)
- Mixed-use maximizes land value

### Risk Factors
- **Industrial Dependence**: If factories close, demand drops
- **Worker Turnover**: Factory workers may change jobs/relocate
- **Infrastructure Stress**: Roads congested, water supply issues in areas
- **Stigma**: Some buyers avoid "industrial" areas
- **Noise/Pollution**: Near factories can be noisy, dusty

## Unique Selling Propositions

### The Guaranteed Tenant Angle
"Imagine a neighborhood where 30,000 people wake up every day needing a place to live close to work. That's Athi River. EPZ operates 6 days a week, workers earn steady salaries, they need housing within 10 minutes. Buy a 2-bedroom for KES 3M, rent to a supervisor for KES 22K/month. You're not chasing tenants - they're chasing you."

### The Multiple-Unit Strategy
"Why buy one expensive property in Nairobi when you can buy 3 units in Athi River for the same price? KES 7.5M gets you 3 two-bedrooms, each renting KES 20K. That's KES 60K monthly income vs. KES 35K from one Nairobi unit. Spread risk, triple income."

### The Factory Manager Own-Stay
"You manage a factory in Athi River, commute 90 minutes daily from Embakasi. You're exhausted. Buy a 3-bedroom here for KES 5M, live 10 minutes from work. Wake up at 7am, home by 6pm, have dinner with your family. That 3 hours daily you save? Priceless. Plus, your property is appreciating 8% annually."

### The Industrial Boom Play
"Athi River EPZ is expanding - new Chinese factories, logistics hubs for SGR, warehousing boom. More factories = more workers = more housing demand. Buy now at KES 3M before prices jump to KES 4M-5M in 3 years. Early mover advantage."
