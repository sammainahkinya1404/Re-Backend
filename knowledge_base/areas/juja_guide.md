## Unique Selling Propositions

### The Yield Champion
"Nairobi CBD bedsitter: KES 2.5M purchase, KES 12K rent = 5.8% yield. Juja bedsitter: KES 1M purchase, KES 8K rent = 9.6% yield. You're getting almost double the return, with half the investment."

### Parent Win-Win Strategy
"You're paying KES 8,000/month for your kid's rent = KES 96K/year = KES 384K over 4 years. Instead, buy a 2-bedroom for KES 3M. Your kid lives free, rent the other room for KES 14K/month. In 4 years, you've earned KES 672K AND you own a KES 3.5M asset. Which makes more sense?"

### Beginner-Friendly Investment
"Want to start real estate but don't have KES 5M? Juja lets you in at KES 1.5M. Buy one bedsitter, learn the game - tenant management, maintenance, rent collection. In 2 years, buy another. Scale gradually, compound your portfolio."

### Cash Flow Machine
"Imagine owning 5 bedsitters in Juja. Cost: KES 5M total. Monthly income: KES 40K. Annual: KES 480K. That's 9.6% yield, covering your mortgage on a different property or funding your kid's school fees. Real estate becomes your second income source."

## Property Matching Tips

**First-Time Investor**: → Single bedsitter, KES 1M-1.5M, walking distance to campus, learn basics
**Parent of Student**: → 2-bedroom, KES 2.5M-3.5M, kid lives free + rental income
**Yield Chaser**: → 6-unit bedsitter block, KES 6M-8M, 10-12% yield, active management
**Build-to-Rent Developer**: → ¼ acre land, KES 1.5M-2.5M, construct 10-unit hostel, 12-15% yield
**Young Professional (Own Stay)**: → 1-bedroom, KES 2M-2.5M, quiet area away from student zones

## Management Tips (Include in Advice)

**Student Tenant Best Practices**:
1. **Collect Rent in Advance**: Semester-based (4 months upfront)
2. **Utilities**: Charge separately (token meter, water bill)
3. **Deposit**: 1-2 months (expect some damage)
4. **Academic Calendar**: Know when students arrive/leave (plan maintenance)
5. **Whatsapp Groups**: Communicate with tenants efficiently
6. **Caretaker**: Essential for 6+ units (10-15% of rent)
7. **Furnishing**: Basic only (bed, desk) - students bring own stuff

## Call-to-Action Suggestions

**For Parents**:
"Your child is in Year 1 at JKUAT. Over 4 years, you'll pay KES 384K in rent (KES 8K × 48 months). Instead, invest KES 1.5M in a bedsitter. Your child lives there, saves you rent, and after graduation you own an asset earning KES 8K/month forever. Want to see available units?"

**For First-Time Investors**:
"Real estate seems expensive, but not in Juja. Start with KES 1.5M for a bedsitter earning KES 8K/month. Learn property management, build confidence, then scale up. I have 3 options ready to view this weekend. Interested?"

**For Yield Chasers**:
"You want cashflow, not just appreciation. A bedsitter block in Juja: KES 6M investment, KES 48K monthly income, 9.6% yield. That's KES 576K annual income - enough to cover your own mortgage or fund another investment. Let me show you the numbers on an actual block for sale."
