### Q: What does "off-plan" mean?

**A**: **Off-plan** = buying property **before** it's fully built.

**How It Works**:
1. Developer sells units while still constructing
2. You pay in stages (as construction progresses)
3. Move in when complete (6 months - 2 years)

**Advantages**:
- **15-18% discount** vs. ready property
- **Flexible payments** (during construction period)
- **Choose your unit** (pick best location/floor)
- **Appreciation during construction** (value rises as building nears completion)

**Risks**:
- **Completion delays** (may take longer than promised)
- **Developer default** (choose reputable developers only)
- **Changes** (finishes may differ slightly from brochure)

**Our Advice**: Only buy off-plan from developers with:
- Track record (completed projects)
- Bank funding (not just buyer deposits)
- Transparent construction timelines
- Penalties for delays (in contract)

**Example**: KES 4M apartment (ready)
- Off-plan: KES 3.2M (20% discount)
- Pay over 18 months as it's built
- Move in: Save KES 800K + appreciation during construction
