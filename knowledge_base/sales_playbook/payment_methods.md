**Example** (KES 3M property):
- Deposit: KES 900,000 (30%)
- Balance: KES 2,100,000
- Monthly: KES 87,500 × 24 months
- Total: KES 3M (no interest if paid on time)

**Plan 2: 36-Month Plan**
- **Deposit**: 20% of purchase price
- **Balance**: Split over 36 months
- **Interest**: 3-5%

### Payment Schedule Options

**Monthly Payments**:
- Most common
- Via M-Pesa or standing order
- Due date: [5th of every month]

**Quarterly Payments**:
- Every 3 months
- 10% discount on quarterly lump sums (vs. monthly)
- Good for business owners with irregular income

**Balloon Payment**:
- Small monthly payments
- Large final payment (30-50% at end)

### How Installment Payments Work

- Reserves the property for 7-14 days
- Refundable if you change mind (within booking period)

**Step 2: Deposit**
- Pay 20-30% deposit within 30 days
- Signs Sale Agreement
- Property officially yours (legally binding)

**Step 3: Monthly Payments**
- Set up M-Pesa auto-payments or standing order
- Receive monthly statements
- Penalties for late payments (usually 1-2% monthly interest on overdue amount)

**Step 4: Balance Clearance**
- Pay final balance
- Title deed transfer process begins
- Property registered in your name

**Step 5: Title Transfer**
- 1-2 months after full payment
- You receive original title deed
- Property 100% yours

### Penalties & Incentives

**Late Payment Penalties**:
- Grace period: 7 days after due date
- After grace: 1-2% monthly interest on overdue amount
- 3 consecutive missed payments: Risk of forfeiture (we try to avoid this - talk to us early if struggling)

**Early Clearance Bonuses**:
- Pay off balance before schedule: 3-5% discount on remaining amount
- Example: KES 1M remaining, pay now = KES 950K-970K (KES 30K-50K savings)

**Referral Incentives**:

- Check receipt has company details
- Keep copies (photo + physical)

- If someone asks for personal account = RED FLAG

**3. Document Everything**
- Screenshot every M-Pesa transaction
- Keep bank transfer slips
- File all receipts chronologically
- Create email trail (confirm payments in writing)

**4. Verify Before Large Payments**
- Before paying KES 500K+, call office to confirm account details
- Use escrow for deposit
- Lawyer present during major transactions

**5. Contractual Protection**
- Read Sale Agreement before signing
- Understand penalties, timelines, developer obligations
- Hire independent lawyer (not seller's lawyer)
- Don't sign blank documents

### Red Flags - When NOT to Pay

**STOP if**:
- Seller rushes you ("pay now or lose the deal")
- Demands cash only (no paper trail)
- Refuses to give official receipt
- Account details change suddenly
- Title deed not shown
- Price "too good to be true"
- Seller not registered company
- No office address or phone number

**If in doubt**: Pause, verify with lawyer, research company, check online reviews.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED PAYMENT QUESTIONS

**Q: Can I pay cash?**
A: For small amounts (under KES 100K), yes. Large cash = risky (robbery, no trace). Use M-Pesa or bank transfer.

**Q: Do you accept cryptocurrency?**
A: Currently, no. Only KES via M-Pesa, bank transfer, or cheque.

**Q: Can I pay from my business account?**
A: Yes, but property title must match payer. If business pays, title may need to be in business name (tax implications - consult accountant).

**Q: What if I miss a payment?**
A: Contact us immediately. We have 7-day grace period. If financial hardship, we can restructure plan (extend timeline, lower monthly amount). Communication is key.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**
A: Within booking period (7-14 days): Yes, full refund minus admin fee (KES 5K-10K)
After signing Sale Agreement: Refunds depend on terms (usually forfeit 10-20% of paid amount)
After 50% paid: No refund, but can sell/transfer to another buyer.

**Q: How do I prove I've paid?**
A: We give you:
- Official receipt for every payment
- Monthly statement showing payments received
- Updated balance statement
- Final clearance certificate (when fully paid)
